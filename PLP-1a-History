Brief History about C++.

C++ is a programming language derived from C and was offically it's own language in 1979, though it was under a 
different name. Originally it was just called "C with classes", then later given the name C++ in 1983. The original 
name helps to describe the problem that C++ was trying to fix, the absense of classes in C. Bjarne Stroustrup is the
man who gave rise to C++. First he made his own programming language called Simula while he was working on his PhD.
He then tried to integrate some of the parts of Simula into C, giving C classes. He was hoping that C would adopt his
changes but C++ ended up just becoming it's own programming langage.

C++ is a very fast language, it's execution speed makes it widly used for things like Operating Systems, Games and
embedded systems (cars, planes, medical equitment, etc.).

I am specifically interested in C++'s application in game development. It is the primary programming language used
in Unreal engine which is one of the leading softwares for 3D game development.
