Discussion questions:

Does your language have keywords or reserved words? How many?
What are the naming requirements for variables in your language? 
What about naming conventions?  Are those enforced by the compiler/interpreter, or just standards in the community?

Is your language statically or dynamically typed?
Strongly typed or weakly typed?
Are some variables mutable while others are immutable? 
What are the operators available for each data type?
Are mixed type operations allowed? If so, how are they accommodated?
At what point are identifier names and operator symbols bound in your language? For example if you declare a (variable, class name, function name), when is it bound to the type, address? When are operators (+,*, etc.) bound to their operations?
Explicitly typed or implicitly typed?
