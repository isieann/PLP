---> RESERVED WORDS <---
------------------------
C++ has an extensive list of key/reserved words
A reserved word is a word that you can not use as a variable name or else it will
mess with the use that is already associtated with the word in a given language.

Some more common reserved words in C++ include:
if, else, return, include, string, bool, int, float etc.

(for a full list of reserved words see here: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/keyword.html)


-------------------------------------
--> NAME REQUIREMENTS/CONVENTIONS <--
-------------------------------------
Classes:
- Pascal Case (PascalCaseIsLikeThis) <- classes must start with an upper case letter
- class name should be a noun
- "_"s aren't allowed in class naming

Functions/Methods:
- Camel Case (camelCaseIsLikeThis) <- functions/methods must start with a lower case letter
- For methods specifically Snake Case can also be used (snake_case_is_like_this)

Variables:
- The first character should be a letter (numbers are allowed but only after at least one letter)
- No keywords
- "_" is the only allowed special character

Some more useful information to know:

C++ is a statically typed language which means that type checking
happens when the program is compiled instead of at run time. It is
also a strongly typed language (even though some people think that
it is weakly typed). It is explicitly typed (though you can implicitly
declare using auto), in C++ you need to declare what type of variable
you are declaring and it will always stay as that variable type.
